# Filter by Category and Tags

## Categories vs tags

This piece 'is a [category] about [tag]'.

When utilizing both categories and tags, there's often some confusion about which one a filter should be. When paired with tags, a category typically describes what the content piece is - perhaps whether it's a video, whitepaper or datasheet.

Tags indicate the high-level topics of the piece, and can frequently feature campaigns and initiatives that site visitors would want to follow. In most cases, it's best practice to treat categories as a broader filter than tags, allowing tags to contribute to finer tuned filtering.

OBS: **Hashtags must be a single continuous string and should be case insensitive**. This means we can use the tag itself as the document ID
